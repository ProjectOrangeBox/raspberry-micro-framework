## mvc framework

Why another PHP framework aren't there already too many?

I agree 100% but, as a PHP developer, I like to challenge myself and see what I can do on my own. It helps me understand and experiment with more complex PHP/MVC techniques. It also provides me with a simple way to try new things.

For example:

1. How do vue.js and PHP work together?
2. How can tinybind.js and PHP work together?
3. What kind of caching can I do on the browser side (browser application cache)?
4. How can I leverage PHP model validation on the browser side?
5. Can I make a universal record level access code?
6. How far can I take Dependency Injection?
7. Can we decouple...
